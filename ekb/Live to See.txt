Intro: Bflat(sus)  F  C  ---  thrice

Verse One:

Bflat(sus)                F             C
Sweet girl, where did you go when I got older? / You just
   Bflat(sus)    F     C      Bflat(sus)   F
dissolved away into my night / I was so in love back then I
   C                        Bflat(sus)             F
was just a shadow / Moving across the walls like a tricky
      C
compromise

Dm         F             C
Okay, so I lost myself in beer and cigarettes / But it was a
Gm         F            C      Dm                   F
long, long summer at my house / Prince Albert would talk to
          C                                        Gm
me on the weekends when the stars got hazy / But I know what
               F                   C
you would have said if you'd been around...

Chorus:


F                 C               Bflat F
"You know I'll be coming for you, baby / (Hush) I've always
C            Bflat  F       C               Bflat       F
been alive inside / I'll be coming for you, baby / If I live
           C                   Bflat (C)
to see you learn to close your eyes."

Bflat(sus)                      F              Bflat(sus)
Truth is I knew just what I was doing / When I folded up in
      C   Bflat(sus)                                 F
mid-July / Back before Matt sold his place / And the big town
                               Bflat(sus)
stood before my face / I got a new guitar and a higher take
   C
on life

Verse Three:

Bflat(sus)              F                 C
I sent a letter down to Stacey back in September / Couldn't
  Bflat(sus)        F               C
believe it when she up and wrote me back / Turns out I was just
  Bflat(sus)             F                  C
a click and a smile from getting through to Sunday / Ah, two
    Bflat(sus)     F                          C
old spirits in the night that got their skins back / (Well how

do you like that?)

Mmm, it's the first day of October / Thinking about Tanqueray
   F              C      Bflat(sus)      F               C
or changing up my name / Cause I've made love in a "Last Minute
                         Bflat(sus)        F           C
Shakedown" / And I was a fool to think I'd ever be the same,..
                                Bflat(sus) F              C
/ (But this is what she said:) / "I'll be coming for you, baby."

I Well I think I wanna save myself instead
