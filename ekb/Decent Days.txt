                           G        D                Am
the New Deal / Pressing to force it all to make some sense /
                C                       G         D
But are we just martyrs for the moment? / With no axe to grind,
   Am              C                Em             D (tacet)
no warm regards to make this theory true / Or be a decent man

Different days, the annalls of a start gone wrong / We wheeled
                        G         D              Am
around, so happy, right under the gun / And just look at where
        C             G    D                              Am
the revolution got us / In bed with our shadows / And the valley
   C          Em              D (tacet)           C   G D
is painted so dark / We're no closer to the mark.

oceans, down coastal green fields, reaching out to find /

What should I believe when the effigies have faces just like
Am        C                   Em            D (tacet)
me? / And assurance stands at one: It'll be decent when you're
