chill / For the first time / There's snow just sitting down
   D          G

now I guess I will

     D                            G
for / To the red-haired singers / To the ones that held us to

the best of our lives / Here we are / The boldest of the

Canonized I was / You will be / We are / From corner seas cut
         G              D/F#                 G
on these winter streets / Strange vows we've learned and kept

             G                                D
part is over / (White) skies have fallen onto Rio Grande / And

that song of whispers / Has left our hands

in, baby / Come on in         / Let us begin,
