<p align=left><B><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Strong For Carrie</B> took fourteen months to write and record, and something like ten years to materialize.&nbsp; In early June of 1998 (looking for a way out, I&#39;m sure, as songwriters often are) I sat down to fall apart and instead penned &quot;Out There Now.&quot;&nbsp; It came as a shock to me...I didn&#39;t think I was capable of that level of self-comprehension just then, and something shifted noticeably.&nbsp; &quot;A Still Rising&quot; followed, after more than a month of renewed exploration, and it stands as a potent indicator, I think, of those boons that might be waiting for you, if you&#39;re lucky enough to get to point B. (You&#39;ll just have to trust me on this one...) Though I didn&#39;t know it, the record had bookends now -- that elusive dual-terminus of a story arc. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Returning to school that autumn, I felt largely healed. Time passes, a mind wanders, to quote my favorite lyricist. From this steadier ground came &quot;Better Tricks,&quot; a pretty massive expansion on the optimism of &quot;Still Rising.&quot;&nbsp; The song contained a reference to the fictitious girl who would eventully become Carrie, and I suppose it was the impetus, the first flicker of a new album&#39;s gestation.&nbsp; It paved the way for &quot;Live to See,&quot; whose retrospective nature got me thinking hard about this nameless, faceless figure, gathering the pieces and so forth. I tried to pin her down as a variation on Springsteen&#39;s Mary in the verses of &quot;When I Stood with Mary&quot; and &quot;Worn Well,&quot; but the pivotal moment, looking back, was &quot;The Later Show,&quot; a tune I literally dreamed into existence.&nbsp; In it I wrote of being &quot;between my first love&#39;s house and home,&quot; and suddenly Mary made sense to<br>
me.&nbsp; I tucked her away and headed for the new year.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  By Christmas I&#39;d written &quot;Decent Days&quot; at the request of a good friend, really pushing that envelope and tumbling all over myself to make ends meet -- rock and roll plus introspection...the famous strangers.&nbsp; &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; closed 1998 on an appropriate note: missing the Grand Illusion but little else. In early January I commissioned myself to write &quot;Amethyst&quot; as a personal birthday present, just to prove I could write a love song with no ties to my own legendary misadventures (time would reatly diminish my success on this one...).&nbsp; February was insane, explosive, opening with &quot;Page Two,&quot; barreling into &quot;Names in Shade&quot; and &quot;Some of Mine (Saints and Babies)&quot; over a two-day period, and slamming shut with &quot;Stranger Music.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Page Two&quot; was a love letter, a definite change of pace, but &quot;Names in Shade&quot; was the breakthrough.&nbsp; It was a nod to my closest friends and a very specific era of our lives -- young, naive, spinning out of control...we were all, in our ways, hunting for a romantic ideal, a culmination of all that adolescent yearning.&nbsp; We were looking for Carrie.&nbsp; &quot;Stranger Music&quot; celebrated this revelation on my part, and then, as they say, I rested. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <B>Strong For Carrie</B> went into production in late May of 1999 under the guise of <B>EKB VII</B>. Eventually it became clear that I was going to be alone on this one, and I had to do some radical rethinking: I put together the most representative list of the past year&#39;s work, changed a few &quot;Mary&quot;s to &quot;Carrie&quot;s, broke the movements with a pair of instrumentals, and closed my eyes as tightly as possible.&nbsp; Recording wrapped up in August, and post-production has stretched into mid-September as I write this.&nbsp; Best I can tell, the album described here is the purest photograph I could manage of one boy&#39;s heaviest reconciliation -- early hopes and later truths.&nbsp; As always, I hope the confines of my stories aren&#39;t too restrictive, that there&#39;s plenty of room left in there. I&#39;m trusting that time will tell, as usual, and until then...</p></font>
