<p align=justify><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Cody Clayton Lindsey was born on January fifth, 1978, a Thursday. His father was a self-employed builder who played Dan Fogelberg and the Eagles for his oldest son on a classical Yamaha guitar, and Cody began writing songs of his own before he was out of kindergarten, imitating the melodies he heard on popular radio. By early high school, he had latched firmly onto the adolescent hard rock that would push him to develop the instrumental prowess he is now known for, but it was the lyricism of men like Paul Simon that made for true inspiration. In December of 1992, Cody took a step that would finally create the songwriting avenue he was searching for.<br>

The boys, both freshmen, had not spoken since elementary school, but Cody didn&#39;t know any other guitarists in town and had no collaborative experience. He accepted Jacob&#39;s offer. Despite an outwardly disasterous first meeting, the duo recognized a creative seriousness in each other right away, and the Evil Kilt Bandits were born.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The end of high school saw Cody graduate as a valedictorian and National Merit Scholar, with his eyes on the University of Texas and a degree in psychology -- just the sort of tool he needed to polish his prose writing skills to a fine point. EKB moved on to college with three amateur albums of original material and a modest following already under their belts. Three more recordings would follow, and the pair would turn down numerous offers to play in Austin...a decision made for two primary reasons: school was the number one priority, and the two simply could not recreate live what they composed in the studio. This was because EKB, though a full band on record, remained only Cody and Jacob. No one else clicked with their vision, so</p></font>

&nbsp; &nbsp;  As 1999 draws to a close, Cody is preparing to move on to medical school. He splits time between Victoria, Texas, his hometown, and the state&#39;s capital. <B>Strong For Carrie</B> is his first effort without lyrical contribution from Rodriguez, written alongside a second novel and a screenplay, the latter penned with Matthew Clark, an old friend. Generated over the course of a year, the album explores the far side of loss, one of Cody&#39;s favorite topics.</p></font>
