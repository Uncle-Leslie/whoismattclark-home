                                                                159
Out There Now,
Intro:       (Gmaj7)...banjo
             Bm D G Asus4
             (all twice)

             D Gmaj7 Bm Asus4
             D Gmaj7 Bm F#msus (tacet)

Verse One:

D                   Gmaj7            Bm           Asus4
From the sound of a door closing / On friends and lovers / And
     D          Gmaj7          Bm          Asus4         D
everything that falls between / That falls outside of my mind
        Gmaj7  Bm    Asus4 D      Gmaj7   Bm   Asus4
/ Where outside it's still raining

D                                Gmaj7   Bm
There was a summer when I wasn't lonely / I can draw you a
Asus4           D          Gmaj7            Bm         Asus4
picture / I can show you a few old pictures / In their dark
                 D      Gmaj7  Bm      Asus4        D
new places / And outside         / Who cares what's outside?
Gmaj7  Bm  F#msus (tacet)

Verse Two:

D                  Gmaj7              Bm              Asus4
They say at twenty-one it gets better / Wake up every day like
         D                          Gmaj 7
everyone else / But still there's a little bottle / In your
Bm                        Asus4          D                 Gmaj7
little white room full of little white reminders / And you say,
        Bm                        Asus4       D   Gmaj7  Bm  Asus4
"What's wrong with me?" / But you still don't listen

D                      Gmaj7                     Bm
If you step out onto a blazing Main Street / And every road
     Asus4     D           Gmaj7             Bm           Asus4
is exactly the same as the night before this smoldering July
           D                  Gmaj7    Bm   Asus4
/ When the fresh coat slipped out from all around me

Chorus:

D        G              D     A   D           G
But I'll dig around for something / Because I feel I owe it
D   A D       G              D  A               Bm       G
that / I will dig around for anything / Because somebody owes
   A        (Gmaj7)
me something now

Interlude: (Gmaj7)...banjo  ---  twice

Verse Three (breezier, softer...high hat?):

D            Gmaj7        Bm                  Asus4     D
You feel you have to say, "Since you went away..," / Of course
               Gmaj7 Bm              Asus4 D
you don't know why / You poor little girl / Standing in shards
     Gmaj7            Bm                          Asus4 D
of November I see the strength I need / Flow like wine away
                      Gmaj7                    Bm  Asus4 D
from me / But I don't feel out of place when I whisper / Fold
             Gmaj7        Bm           Asus4
it up / Just fold it up / Fold it up / Fold it up

(D  Gmaj7  Bm  Asus4 --- twice...build second time)

(Bm)       (Asus4)  (D)
And let me see those eyes

Bridge:  D  G --- three times (hold last chord...fill)

Verse Three:
D             Gmaj7         Bm            Asus4  D
I'm not going out there now / You must be crazy / All I ever
Gmaj7  Bm Asus4  D                  Gmaj7            Bm
wanted was     a heart to break / A soul to take / A love that
        Asus4           D           G D/F# A
I could celebrate / And don't you believe me / When I say I
(D)
love you?

Outro: D  Gmaj7  Bm  Asus4 --- twice
       D

(And on days like this
"The lover showeth how he is forsaken")
