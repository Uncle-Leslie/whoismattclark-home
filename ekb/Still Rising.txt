Verse One:

G               A7sus       Cmaj7            G
If you've got a front porch / Step out on it / If you've got
     A7sus  Cmaj7         G                 A7sus        Cmaj7
a horizon / Look upon it / There might be a devil in the details

Maybe I'm a murderer / I know I am a thief / My words have bent
                 Cmaj7                    G
so sinister / My lies run very deep / But mister I'm just as
A7sus     Cmaj7             G                     A7sus
lonely as you will ever be / And in the eyes of a jealous spirit
Cmaj7

Em7    D    Cmaj7                            Em7    D

die

Chorus:

G                 D/F#          Em7           G

D/F#             Em7                         G        D/F#
made in faith is pushed back into the ground / I have lived
           Em7    Cmaj7                  (Cadd9)
and I have lost / Time and time again / Between my lonesome
(G)

rain / Wanna drive like a last survivor / With no one to call

         G           A7sus              Cmaj7         G
my name / It must be grand, so grand to be long gone / To not

give a damn if you are good enough / Or whether you

Cmaj7                  G                A7sus
been a good two years / And maybe these trinkets I've got are

not a shame to hold your fear
